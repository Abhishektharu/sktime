Code of Conduct
===============

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to
ensure an that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling
experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the sktime project
is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at
all times.

The sktime community council, and all project members,
are dedicated to a **harassment-free experience for
everyone**, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
age or religion. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of
our community in any form**.

We are dedicated to a **fair and equal opportunities environment** for everyone,
and therefore are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious
collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills,
and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to
conform to the following Code of Conduct.

1 Introduction
--------------

sktime is a community-oriented and -led project.

We value the involvement of everyone in the community, and strive to be an open
community. We commit to provide fair and revarding opportunities for everyone without
restriction, to participate, learn, and become leaders of the community. We expect from
members of our community to create such opportunities for others as have been created
for them.

We are committed to scientific quality and strive to be an open forum on matters
of technical content and open community governance. All community members are expected
to adhere to the principle of free speech in academia and science, in order to create
the best possible science and the best possible open community.

We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning,
teaching and contributing. All participants in our in-person events and online
communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in activities
associated with the sktime project is required to conform to this Code
of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the
sktime project including, but not limited to, in-person focus groups and
workshops, and communications online via GitHub.

The communicty council of sktime (see current composition on "roles")
is responsible for defining the Code of Conduct,
and can be contacted under info@sktime.org.

The Code of Conduct Committee of sktie is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.
Reports can be made via the sktime issue tracker, and will be kept confidential.

2 Code of Conduct
-----------------

The sktime team are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As
such, we do not tolerate:
* behaviour that is disrespectful to our
community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.
* discrimination or harassment based on protected characteristics, including
restriction of fair opportunities based on protected characteristics
* silencing of reasonable opinions and stifling of free speech on topics within
  the project scope (science and open community operations)

In the rare cases where our ideals are in conflict, we strive to protect,
in the context of power dynamics, the less powerful party or parties.

Protected characteristics as referred to above include, but are not limited to:
gender identity, gender expression, sex assigned at birth, biological sex,
genetic information, sexual orientation, disability status, physical appearance,
body size, citizenship, nationality, national origin, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy,
familial status, family background, veteran status, trade union membership,
religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age,
socio-economic status, neurotypicality or -atypicality, education, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in the sktime project activities is required
to conform to this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all
spaces managed by the sktime project including, but not limited to, in
person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub.
By participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the
procedures by which the sktime project core development team resolves
any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing
of their personal information.

2.1 Expected Behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are confident that our community members will together build a
supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online
communications. The following bullet points set out explicitly what we
hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:

-  **Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences**. Do not
   engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist,
   or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.
   In disagreements, assume best intentions.
-  **Use welcoming and inclusive language**. Exclusionary comments or
   jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address
   others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate
   of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and
   respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!)
   language for some participants.
-  **Do not harass people**. Harassment includes unwanted physical
   contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that
   consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are
   unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask
   them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.
-  **Respect the privacy and safety of others**. Do not take photographs
   of others without their permission. Do not share other participant’s
   personal experiences without their express permission. Note that
   posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information
   of others without their consent ("doxing") is a form of harassment.
-  **Be considerate of others’ participation**. Everyone should have an
   opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments
   succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do
   not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments
   until they have finished speaking.
-  **Do not hesitate to voice critical opinions, and accept constructive
   criticism gracefully**. A diverse space of opinions and observations is
   crucial for fairness and diversity of our community, as well as its scientific quality.
   Free speech and constant scrutiny directed at those in power is also essential to ensure
   accountability and fair operations of our community, and to prevent groupthink or in-group dynamics.
-  **Don’t be a bystander**. If you see something inappropriate
   happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but
   feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of
   Conduct response team for support.
-  As an overriding general rule, please **be intentional in your
   actions and humble in your mistakes**.

All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either
online or in-person. See `this explanation of the four social
rules <https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules>`__ - no
feigning surprise, no well-actually's, no back-seat driving, no subtle
-isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.

2.2 Unacceptable Behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by sktime community members at any
project event or platform include:

-  written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
   on the basis of membership of any specific group
-  causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
   following, or intimidation
-  violent threats or language directed against another person
-  the display of sexual or violent images
-  unwelcome sexual attention
-  nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
-  sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
-  insults or put downs
-  sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
-  excessive swearing
-  incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
-  continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or
   recording) with someone after being asked to stop
-  publication of private communication without consent
-  allocating sktime resources or funding in a way that disadvantages by
   protected characteristic such as nationality, socio-economic status, religion or belief,
   or other forms of systemic discrimination
-  allocating sktime resources or funding in a way that confers advantages to personal networks,
   e.g., by preventing advertising of opportunities, or not applying best practice in recruitment
-  attempts to obfuscate the paper trail or reduce transparency of operations of sktime

2.3 Common precedent rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, CoC requirements end up in conflict with each other.
We outline a few precedent examples in how these are traded off.

Examples:

* contributor criticizing leadership for handing resources to personal network, leadership invoking "discomfort"
* passionate disagreement on technical content between contributors
* accidental violations of CoC due to protected characteristics of the person violating the CoC
* systemic issues whose resolution causes discomfort in the community

Precedent rules:

* the less powerful party should be protected, i.e., CoC cannot be invoked by lead community member to silence critique of how funds are spent.
  But, CoC should protect new contributors or early career members from more powerful community members, e.g., in operational or technical disputes.
* technical content is not invalidated by tone, but tone must remain civil at all times.
  I.e., valid arguments are not discarded because of tone, but participants in a technical
  dispute may be punished for tone that is unwelcoming, e.g., name calling etc.
* conditions that make compliance with certain aspects of CoC more difficult should be taken into account,
  especially in parties that are the less powerful in a dynamic. Common examples are certain forms of neuroatypicality.
  A more illustrative but very rare example would be Tourette's with the rare swearing tic that cannot be "turned off".
* issues of systemic exclusion or discrimination should be addressed when apparent, even at the cost of some community discomfort.
  E.g., meetings should be moved to less convenient times, or processes made more "formal",
  if not doing so would exclude others in a discriminatory fashion.

Behaviour that is clearly racist, sexist, etc, is always a CoC violation, and never part of trade-offs.

2.4 Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are
expected to comply immediately. This applies to all sktime community
events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant
engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of
the core development team may warn the offender, ask them to leave the
event or platform (without refund), or impose any other appropriate
sanctions (see the `enforcement manual <#enforcement-manual>`__ for
details).

2.5 Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Code of Conduct is not intended as a static set of rules by which
everyone must abide. Rather, you are invited to make suggestions for
updates or clarifications by contacting the sktime community council at
info@sktime.org, or by making a pull request to this document on
GitHub.

3 Incident Reporting Guidelines
-------------------------------

3.1 Contact points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please report CoC incidents via the [reporting tool in the issue tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/new/choose).

3.2 Alternate contact points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of conflict of interest of sktime CoC committee members, you can report
through the [NumFOCUS CoC process](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct),
or, in case of events, to the organisation at which the event is taking place (e.g., a university).

3.3 What to do if someone is in physical danger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you believe someone is in physical danger, please contact the
appropriate emergency responders.

3.4 Code of Conduct Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We believe it is important to have an actionable plan before something
happens. We therefore have a detailed enforcement policy which is
available in the Enforcement Manual below.

4 Enforcement Manual
--------------------

This is the enforcement manual followed by the sktime project research
team. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're
consistent and fair. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct should be
respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.

4.1 The Code of Conduct Committee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Code of Conduct committee is currently on hiatus and re-organizing.

Please use the NumFOCUS CoC reporting process in the transition period.

4.2 Urgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to
anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any member of the community
may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect the safety of any
community member. This can include contacting law enforcement (or other
local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the sktime team.

If the act is ongoing, any community member may act immediately, before
reaching consensus, to diffuse the situation. In ongoing situations, any
member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available in this
enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online, or removal from a
physical space.

In situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally,
they must inform Dr Franz Király as soon as possible, and report their
actions for review within 24 hours.

4.3 Less-Urgent Situations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon receiving a report of an incident, the Code of Conduct committee
will review the incident and determine, to the best of her ability:

-  whether this is an ongoing situation
-  whether there is a threat to anyone's physical safety
-  what happened
-  whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
-  who, if anyone, was the bad actor

This information will be collected either in person or in writing. The
Code of Conduct committee will provide a written summary of the
information surrounding the incident. All participants will be
anonymised in the summary report, referred to as "Community Member 1",
"Community Member 2", or "Research Team Member 1". The "de-anonymising
key" will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated
reports against the same person over time.

The Code of Conduct committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon
within one week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in
that time, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will respond to the
reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.

4.4 Resolutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Code of Conduct committee will seek to agree on a resolution by
consensus of all members investigating the report in question. If the
committee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, Dr Franz
Király, as currently longest serving CC member of the sktime project, will break the tie.

Possible responses may include:

-  A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community
   members.
-  A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a
   community member.
-  A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the
   Code of Conduct.
-  Nothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the
   scope of this Code of Conduct.
-  A private in-person conversation between a member of the research
   team and the individual(s) involved. In this case, the person who has
   the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.
-  A private written reprimand from a member of the research team to the
   individual(s) involved. In this case, the research team member will
   deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing Dr
   Franz Király for record keeping.
-  A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that
   the violation occurred (i.e. on the listserv for a listserv
   violation; GitHub for a GitHub violation, etc.). The committee may
   choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
-  An imposed "time out" from online spaces. Dr Franz Király will
   communicate this "time out" to the individual(s) involved.
-  A permanent or temporary ban from some or all sktime project spaces
   (GitHub, in-person events etc). The research team will maintain
   records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future,
   extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or
   otherwise maintained. If a member of the community is removed from an
   event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they
   miss.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of
the Code of Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any
other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The Code of
Conduct committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and
must note feedback for the record. However, the Code of Conduct
committee is not required to act on this feedback.

4.5 Conflicts of Interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of conflict of interest of sktime CoC committee members, you can report
through the [NumFOCUS CoC process](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct),
or, in case of events, to the organisation at which the event is taking place (e.g., a university).
