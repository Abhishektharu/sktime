Tutorials
=========

We have a number of tutorial notebooks. If you like to run them interactively, you can
`launch them on binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alan-turing-institute/sktime/main?filepath=examples>`_
without having to install anything.

We assume basic familiarity with `scikit-learn`_. If you havenâ€™t worked with scikit-learn before, check out their
`getting-started guide`_.

The notebook files can be found `here <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples>`_.
